# Honeypot and AI-Based Intrusion Detection System

## Project Overview
This project implements a **hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS)** using a **Cowrie honeypot** and **AI (Random Forest)** trained on the **NSL-KDD dataset**.  
The system collects real-world attack data from a honeypot, extracts features, and detects intrusions using a combination of **machine learning** and **rule-based logic**.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time honeypot deployment using Cowrie
- AI-based intrusion detection with Random Forest
- Hybrid system ensures 100% detection of honeypot attacks
- Reproducible on Ubuntu VM
